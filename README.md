# 📄 README — Root Project

## Programmer – Measuresoft Task

---

## Project Overview

This project contains multiple tasks designed to evaluate problem solving skills,
code clarity, and the ability to work with different technologies.

The focus is on:

- Clear logic
- Simple solutions
- Completing full pipelines rather than partial demos

## Part B – Desktop Application

A simple drawing application implemented using:

- Python (PyQt)
- JavaScript (HTML Canvas)

Focus:

- Mouse events
- Drawing logic
- Desktop UI fundamentals

---

## Part C – Data Analysis & Machine Learning

- Historical oil price analysis
- Feature engineering (price change)
- Anomaly detection using IsolationForest
- Trained model saved as `model.pkl`

---

## Part D – Web Application (Model Deployment)

- Flask web application
- Loads trained ML model
- Accepts user input
- Displays prediction result

---

## Setup Notes (Important)

- Each part uses its own virtual environment
- Dependencies must be installed per task
- `model.pkl` must be generated in Part C before running Part D

---

## Final Notes

- The project avoids unnecessary complexity
- All tasks are fully runnable following the documented steps
- Emphasis is placed on understanding and explainability
