## Programmer – Measuresoft Task

### Project Overview

This project contains multiple tasks that focus on **problem solving**,
**logic clarity**, and **translating ideas between Python and JavaScript**.

The goal of this project is **not advanced frameworks or complex machine learning**,
but writing clear, understandable code that solves real problems.

## Part B – Desktop Application (PyQt)

A simple drawing application that allows the user to draw shapes using the mouse.

**Implemented twice:**

- Python (PyQt)
- JavaScript (HTML Canvas)

**Focus:**

- Mouse events
- Drawing logic
- Understanding how the same idea can be implemented in different languages

---

## Part C – Data Analysis & Machine Learning (Oil & Gas)

Analysis of historical crude oil prices to detect unusual price changes.

**Key points:**

- Uses simple statistical analysis
- Calculates year-to-year price changes
- Detects anomalies using Z-score
- No heavy machine learning libraries

**Focus:**

- Data understanding
- Logic clarity
- Choosing the simplest solution that fits the problem

---

## Part D – Web Application (Model Deployment)

A small web application that allows the user to test whether a price change
is normal or anomalous.

**Implemented twice:**

- Python (Flask)
- JavaScript (Node.js + Express)

**Focus:**

- Backend logic
- Handling user input
- Applying previously calculated statistical values

---

## Technologies Used

- Python (PyQt, Flask)
- JavaScript (Node.js, Express)
- HTML / CSS
- Bootstrap

---

## General Notes

- The project focuses on clarity and simplicity
- All tasks avoid unnecessary complexity
- Logic is prioritized over frameworks
- Each task has its own README with detailed instructions

---

## Final Note

Each part of this project was solved using the **simplest and most suitable approach**,
with an emphasis on understanding and explainability.
