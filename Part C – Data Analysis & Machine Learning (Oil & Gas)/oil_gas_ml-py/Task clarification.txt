📄 Project Explanation – Oil Price Anomaly Detection

In this task, I worked on analyzing historical crude oil prices to detect unusual changes between consecutive years.

The main idea was not to build a complex machine learning model, but to solve the problem using a simple and clear statistical approach that fits the nature of the data.

Step 1: Data Loading

First, I read the dataset from a CSV file and extracted two main values:

* The year
* The oil price for that year

I stored these values in separate lists to make them easy to process later.

Step 2: Year-to-Year Price Change

Instead of working directly with prices, I calculated the difference in price between each year and the year before it.
This helped me focus on how much the price changed, not just the price itself.

Step 3: Define What Is “Normal”

To understand what a normal price change looks like, I calculated:

* The average (mean) yearly change
* The standard deviation, which shows how much prices usually vary

These two values give a clear baseline for normal behavior.

Step 4: Detect Anomalies

For each yearly price change, I measured how far it was from the average using a Z-score.
If the change was much larger than normal (above a chosen threshold), I marked that year as an anomaly.

This means the price movement in that year was unusually high or low compared to typical behavior.

Step 5: Output Results

Finally, I printed all detected anomalies with:

* The year
* The oil price
* The size of the change
* How unusual it was compared to normal changes

This makes the results easy to read and understand.

Why This Approach

I chose this method because it is:

* Simple and transparent
* Easy to explain and debug
* Suitable for historical time-based data

It achieves the goal of anomaly detection without unnecessary complexity.
